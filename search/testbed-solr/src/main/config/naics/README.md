ABOUT THIS COLLECTION
=====================
  
Collection with many suggester implementations for comparing them.

It uses NAICS code because Health data was not as good for testing
the feature.  We need many possible short values and NAICS is perfect for that.
It also has the concept of hierarchy we can use to showcase that as well.
