			<p>The COVID-19 Web content inventory tool relies on data from
				two sources:
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Canada.ca search results</li>
				<li>AEM web crawl</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We aim to update the tool daily.</p>

			<p>You can use the tool to validate and improve metadata. You can
				also identify:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>what COVID-19 content exists for a particular theme or
					department</li>
				<li>duplication or overlap</li>
				<li>out-of-date materials</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Tool use examples</h2>
			<p>These examples show specific uses for validation of content
				and updates to metadata.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>E.g. The Benefits theme lead wants to ensure there
					are no out-dated alerts</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the left side of the page, select Benefits in the theme
					drop down</li>
				<li>Select “alerts” for content type</li>
				<li>Click “Filter” button to show results</li>
				<li>Click and hold the URL column header and reposition it to
					the left of the page title</li>
				<li>Select each page URL to verify that the alerts are still
					accurate</li>
			</ul>


			<p>
				<strong>E.g. The Department of Finance wants to ensure
					their COVID-19 pages are following the metadata guidance for titles</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the left side of the page, select Department of Finance

					alert, with some content related to COVID-19, usually in relation
					to a service interruption.</li>
