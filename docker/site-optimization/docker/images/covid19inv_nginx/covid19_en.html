			<h2 class="modal-title">Web Content Inventory Instructions</h2>
		</header>
		<div class="modal-body">
			<p>The COVID-19 Web content inventory tool relies on data from
				two sources:
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Canada.ca search results</li>
				<li>AEM web crawl</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We aim to update the tool daily.</p>

			<p>You can use the tool to validate and improve metadata. You can
				also identify:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>what COVID-19 content exists for a particular theme or
					department</li>
				<li>duplication or overlap</li>
				<li>out-of-date materials</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Tool use examples</h2>
			<p>These examples show specific uses for validation of content
				and updates to metadata.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>E.g. The Benefits theme lead wants to ensure there
					are no out-dated alerts</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the left side of the page, select Benefits in the theme
					drop down</li>
				<li>Select “alerts” for content type</li>
				<li>Click “Filter” button to show results</li>
				<li>Click and hold the URL column header and reposition it to
					the left of the page title</li>
				<li>Select each page URL to verify that the alerts are still
					accurate</li>
			</ul>


			<p>
				<strong>E.g. The Department of Finance wants to ensure
					their COVID-19 pages are following the metadata guidance for titles</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the left side of the page, select Department of Finance
					in the departments list</li>
				<li>Click the filter button to show results
				<li>Click and hold the TITLE column and move it to the right of
					the Department column
				<li>A review of results shows COVID appears in some cases, but
					not all
				<li>Click the “Excel” button towards the top of the page to
					download a spreadsheet of these results
				<li>Use the spreadsheet to provide clear instructions to the
					department content manager</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Considerations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The tool is available in English and French</li>
				<li>The left side of the page provides the main site filters –
					theme, department and four types of content:</li>
				<li>Main COVID-19 content returns pages that include
					substantive information on health, economics, restrictions, etc.
					Generally, pages accessible from Canada.ca/covid19 are “main
					COVID-19” content.</li>
				<li>Alerts returns pages that include an visual and textual
					alert, with some content related to COVID-19, usually in relation
					to a service interruption.</li>
				<li>Links returns pages that include a link to a page with
					COVID-19 content</li>
				<li>News returns 5 types of news releases and announcements,
					including:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>backgrounders</li>
					<li>media advisories</li>
					<li>news releases</li>
					<li>speeches</li>
					<li>statements</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The columns can be rearranged by clicking, holding and
					dragging them to the position you want The toggles at the top of
					the page give you additional control over what you see Use the
					Filter reset button if your results are not what you expected</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Generate an Excel report for internal use</h2>
			<p>To generate an Excel report:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the filter tool, to get the results you want,</li>
				<li>click the Excel button.</li>
				<li>Use the comments column in the Excel report to indicate
					changes or questions for your web team, program area or
					communications team</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This may be useful for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>corrections
				<li>removal or archiving of pages</li>
				<li>adding new pages to your cluster</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Submit comments to the Digital Transformation Office (DTO)</h2>
			<p>To submit comments about a specific page to the DTO, click the
				Submit button in the Comments column for that page in the inventory
				tool. Comments are sent to: dto.btn@tbs-sct.gc.ca</p>

			<p>Comments will help us to complete a QA on the tool. Right now
				we see this tool as an alpha release, there are improvements and
				corrections required.</p>
